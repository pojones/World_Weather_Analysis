# Weather Analysis and Vacation Planning with Google API
## Overview
This project uses Python libraries and the Google API to generate a vacation itinerary based off real-time weather data. A list of cities is generated based off temperature criteria set by the user. For each city on this list, a hotel nearest the cityâ€™s geographical center is recorded. The user may then specify up to four of the potential destinations and a driving route layer map will be generated, complete with interactive markers that show hotel information when selected. 
## Results
Weather data is pulled from two thousand randomly generated cities and filtered by average temperature (range: 75-90). The four cities selected for a potential roadtrip [Westport, Yarmouth, Norfolk, Palmer] and the driving route are shown here:
